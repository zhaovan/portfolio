# Ivan Zhao is a designer, engineer, and writer with a love of animations, comics, games, and type.

My research interests revolve around tools, computational systems, and play. Specifically, I'm interested in how computers and systems create new affordances that push the boundaries of human capability or devise meaning to our lived experience. I love to play around, tinker with, and create new tools that fundamentally improve how we create art.

My creative interests revolve around a devotion to craft, narrative, and storytelling. I am fascinated by work that meanders, sits, and reckons with nonlinear narratives. One such form, comics, provides a unique lens to story crafting and if you want to learn more, I recommend Scott McCloud's [Understanding Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics). To say it changed me is an understatement.

Outside of my main line of work, I make small games and tools, write poetry, and bake bread. Some of my work has been physically shown in places such as the _SF Public Library_, _Silver Sprocket_, _Kearny Street Workshop_, _Providence Place Library_, _Letterform Archive_, and _Harvey Milk Photo Center_. My site specific work can be found in _Taper_, _thehtml.review_, and _The New River_. I'm grateful that my work has been supported by organizations such as _Kearny Street Workshop_ and _Kundiman_.

Currently residing in San Francisco by way of Philadelphia, Basking Ridge, Bellevue, and Providence. Come say hi, I have tons of bakery recommendations.

### Availability

I'm always open to chat and would love to make, create, scheme, cofacilitate anything that you think I would be a great addition towards.

Need someone to prototype some weird thing you're making? Have some images you need to animate? A new typeface? I'm on it.
