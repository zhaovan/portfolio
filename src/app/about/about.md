# Ivan Zhao is a designer, programmer, & writer with a love of animations, comics, games, & type.

I'm interested in creating work with nonlinear narratives, forms, and mechanics that reckon with digital, diasporic, and queer identity. My practice interrogates computational and individual agency, and the language and visualization of translation, characters, and silences.

My research interests revolve around tools, computational systems, and play. Specifically, I'm interested in how computers and systems create new affordances that push the boundaries of human capability or devise meaning to our lived experience. I love to play around, tinker with, and create new tools that fundamentally improve how we create art.

Some of my work has been exhibited in places such as _SF Public Library_, _Silver Sprocket_, _Kearny Street Workshop_, _Providence Place Library_, _Culture Hub_, _Letterform Archive_, and _Harvey Milk Photo Center_. My webart work can be found in _Taper_, _thehtml.review_, and _The New River_. I'm grateful that my work has been supported by organizations such as _Kearny Street Workshop_, _Community of Writers_, and _Brooklyn Poetry_.

Currently residing in San Francisco by way of Philadelphia, Basking Ridge, Bellevue, and Providence. Come say hi, I have tons of bakery and restaurant recommendations.

### Availability

Curently open to new projects on a case by case basis. Need someone to prototype some weird thing you're making? Have some images you need to animate? A new typeface? on it.
