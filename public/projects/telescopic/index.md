Telescopic Text is an open source react component inspired by [this project](https://www.telescopictext.org/) for experimental writing and creating expanding texts. While that platform primarily serves as a method for composing and writing, this package is designed for developers and writers with some coding knowledge to integrate it themselves. Or me. It's for me tbh.
