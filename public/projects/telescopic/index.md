Telescopic Text is an open source React component inspired by [this project](https://www.telescopictext.org/) for experimental writing and creating expanding texts. While that platform primarily serves as a method for composing and writing, this package is designed for developers and writers with some coding knowledge to integrate it themselves. Or me. It's for me tbh.

You can find more details and implementation on the github page and on the README.
