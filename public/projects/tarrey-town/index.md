Tarrey Town is a side quest in the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I forgot exactly why I made this but there's a fun part about one of the side quests that augments the music depending on how far you get into the side quest. It's small stuff like this that makes me fall in love with art and media. Also an extremely early react project for me.
