Convo is a handwritten, comic-book style typeface inspired by the Paper Mario series. I had the opportunity to work on this project during my time at Type West, a year long program in type design, calligraphy, and lettering.

Coming into the program, I was surprised that I was accepted in the first place considering I had little to no lettering background. What I did have, however, was a love of old video games, some good old fashioned programming skills, and a desire to learn as much as possible.

I'll have a blog post up with a more in depth breakdown of my experience at Type West (and the world of type design in the future) but for a process / breakdown of the entire project, check out this type specimen site, made with all your favorite web tools.
