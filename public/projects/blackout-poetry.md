Blackout Poetry Generator is a small project investigating two things: what are ways that we can create poetry on the internet and if there are ways for computers to "generate" good poems without using Large Language Models. Frontend build in react/js, backend script written in python.

This project uses a [corpus](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus) generously supplied by Allison Parrish (professor at NYU) which "trains" a Markov Model on various lines of poetry. Each sentence is transformed through nltk to convert words to part of speech.
