Rhyme Time is a project for Deep Learning built on training LSTM's to produce lines of poetry, specifically for limericks. Words were converted to the phoneme representation of the word, which was significant for rhyme schemes since words that have the same character structure don't necessarily rhyme (which is what the thumbnail is made up of).
