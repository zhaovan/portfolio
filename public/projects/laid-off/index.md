YOU JUST GOT LAID OFF is a web piece in response to the mass layoffs that occurred during 2022. Made in response to the frustration of seeing the corporate neglect of how layoffs were treated, it was also a personal response to having my new grad offer (from productivity startup) rescinded.

In order to get the list of companies, I scraped an online Airtable list of all of the companies that went through layoffs which were provided in a public database. From there, I took layoff letters from the biggest companies that went through it (Stripe, Facebook, Google, etc.) and procedurally generated a "new layoff letter" based off the sentences that were used. It functions as a sort of collage, where it half works half doesn't but interrogates / exemplifies the similarity that these places have in their approach to conducting layoffs and the use of corporate jargon.
