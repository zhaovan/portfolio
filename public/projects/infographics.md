In spring 2022, I snuck into a class called Mapping Information at RISD in the Graphic Design department. With a strong desire to take at least one real RISD class in my senior spring after a covid filled The projects were to document a process that had at least 10 different steps, to showcase a narrative in a way that wasn't storyboarded, and to create a country infographic with many charts and graphics.
