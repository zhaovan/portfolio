A world of space is an interactive game about finding yourself on the internet, the black infinity of space, fathers, and understanding yourself as the child of someone else. I had the honor of working with [Maxwell Neely-Cohen](https://www.maxy.world/) who graciously served as an editor, friend, and supporter throughout the whole process. This piece was published as part of v2 of the [thehtml.review](https://thehtml.review/) but can be found at at it's own link [here](https://www.aworldof.space/).

### Process

In it's early infancy, I was interested in creating a game that investigated agency on the web. To be online but be transported into a different world. To use sonic qualities are immersion. And to question whether our choices on the web mean anything.
