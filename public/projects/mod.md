Mod (named after Modular), is a typeface made during Type West 2023 as an exercise in building typefaces from various components. In this specific exercises, we were given a semi circle, a quarter circle, a square, and a triangle. While there were many different ways to approach this, I was interested in the geometric nature of the various shapes and wanted to make a typeface that respected the original form.

Each glyph can be divided into four quadrants where any number of elements can be placed to form a particular shape. However, there are only a finite number of permutations which made some of the shapes and characters difficult to differentiate. As such, I tried to consider the glyphs abstractly, distilling them down to their abstract most shapes.
