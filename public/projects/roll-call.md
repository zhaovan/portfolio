# Roll Call

<img src="/thumbnails/roll-call.png">

Designer and developer for a side project with a bunch of different folks to engage voters for the 2020 election in response to Trump's decision to make voting more difficult for mail-in voters. Sprinted on the project for two weeks before dropping as a result of local grassroots movements that were ultimately successful. Designed in Figma, developed using React Native.
