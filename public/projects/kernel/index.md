Kernel Magazine is a literary magazine under Reboot focused on tech, society, and power. Run every year, it's one of Reboot's biggest projects along with the student fellowship.

I had the opportunity to serve as a web and print designer and web developer for the project along with four other people (one print designer, one web designer, and two developers). Print was done in Indesign and Procreate. Website was made with NextJS, React, Javascript, and a custom CMS was built.
