Convo is a handwritten, comic-book style typeface inspired by the Paper Mario series. I had the opportunity to work on this project during my time at Type West, a year long program type design, calligraphy, and lettering.

Coming into the program, I was honestly surprised that I got accepted in the first place considering I had little to no lettering background. What I did have, however, was a love of old video games and some good old fashioned programming skills.
