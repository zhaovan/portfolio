Inspired by Vannevar Bush's piece [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/), I created Watcher as an experiment in interfacing with my own knowledge.

More information can be found on the repo but this project was built with a react/js frontend. The backend is a static python script that scrapes the relevant data (twitter, obsidian, email newsletters, and blog post). This was one of my first big projects in investigating creative tools and I was extremely happy with how it turned out. More technical details on the repo.
