Ten As In Sky is an ambient piece that investigates how it's possible to paint with type. In it, the main prompt was in response to the call for pitch in Taper #10, which was to think about the number ten. This work recognizes the notion that ten is heaven (天) in Japanese, and uses this perspective to create a dynamic web painting. The characters fall at various speeds, simulating the rain. If you stay for long enough, the rain (雨) pools together, creating undulating waves in the ground (地).

This work, in retrospective, is heavily interested in typographic notions and concrete poetry. Chinese (and Japanese) characters provide a rich tapestry to understand how glyphs and script are themselves, visual work. Outside of their legibility, the charcters have a history as pictographs, creating an entire scene with typographic forms.
