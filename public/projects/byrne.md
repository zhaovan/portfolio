Byrne is a Caslon revival based off the typeface used in the book, <b>The first six books of the Elements of Euclid </b> by <i> Oliver Byrne</i>. Made during my time at Type West, this was the first ever typeface that I worked on to some level of completion. Below is a process book with some specimens made for class.
